# Python Packages
- pip install Pillow imagehash
- cd droidbot
    - pip install e .

# Prereqs
- Need to have Python 3.9 (3.13 does not work. IDK about other versions)
- Android emulator needs to on Android SDK/API 31 or older
- Can use android studio or another emulator just need to have the emulator running
- Need to use androguard version 3.4.0a1 (pip install androguard==3.4.0a1)

# How to Run
- Have emulator running
- Run ***startDLD.py*** in DLD (NOT start.py in droidbot)
- Ctrl + C to cancel whenver. As of right now it runs indefinitely I think
- Output should be in "DLD/output" (Need to change this later when running for multiple APK's)
